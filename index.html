				<h1><strong>IMPOSSIBLE OCTOPUS FITNESS</strong></h1>
				<p>Impossible Octopus Fitness is a new, revolutionary fitness/diet plan which will push your body to its limits and give you the flexibility of an octopus! Sonds impossible, right? Well, it isn't!</p>
				<p>Octopodes have eight limbs and no skeleton, so they are able to manipulate eight objects independently and squeeze through a crevice the thickness of a quarter. Many octopi even have the seemingly impossible ability to adapt their visual appearance to their surroundings and become effectively invisible. A leapord may not be able to change its spots, but an octopus totally can. Impossible Octopus Fitness is all about training you to acheive similar feats.</p>
				<p>Impossible Octopus Fitness consists of three phases of training: Flexibilty, Strength, and Camoflauge. First, in Flexibilty, you will stretch for 18 hours a day until you can wrap your arm around your body twice. After performing the wrap, you graduate into Strength. In strength, you train until you can perform impossible feats like the famous Octopus Lift, in which you raise eight 50 kilogram wights independently and simultaneously. This sounds impossible since you only have four limbs where an octopus has eight, but you have joints as well! wights will be attached at your feet, hands, knees, and elbows while you lie on your back. Your fitness levels will be unrivaled by any mere human. After graduating from strength, you will enter the camoflauge class. An octopus can change its appearance rapidly and effortlessly, which you must strive to match. All humans exhibit this ability innately through tanning, but few realize the true potential of human biocamoflauge. </p>
				<p>If you mant to be more than a human and join the ranks of the octopodes, contact us today to begin <strong>Impossible Octopus Fitness!</strong></p>
